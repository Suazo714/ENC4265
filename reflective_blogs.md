# Wayback Analysis

I believe that there’s a set standard when it comes to visiting almost any sort of website these days. Over the last few years, there has been a push for a more “modern” appeal to just about everything that we come into contact within our daily lives. From homes to public transportation, classroom technology, entertainment, the internet, etc. Because of this, I think it's quite interesting on how far we have come with both technology and the internet.

_YouTube in 2012_

Using the Wayback Machine, I was able to go through some of my favorite websites from when I was a kid. Some of those websites were CoolMathGames, Instagram, Netflix, YouTube, and many others. Back in the day, with these types of websites, there was a distinct pattern in which they all had harsh colors, sharp image cropping, and overall had a lifeless distinction to them. Nowadays, when you visit these same websites, they all have this modern touch to it such as having a better color gradients and similar placements with buttons and text boxes.

After going through all of these different websites, it’s clear on what has become the standard norm for current day websites. Colorful graphics, gifs, animations, and overall a modern "touch" is what makes our favorite websites so popular. It’s not entirely jarring to see that these set standards have taken place because of how it represents on how far digital media has come. Going through these websites as their older versions was very refreshing as it reminded me of how simple things used to be.
