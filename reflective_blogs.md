# Wayback Analysis

I believe that there’s a set standard when it comes to visiting almost any sort of website these days. Over the last few years, there has been a push for a more “modern” appeal to just about everything that we come into contact within our daily lives. From homes to public transportation, classroom technology, entertainment, the internet, etc. Because of this, I think it's quite interesting on how far we have come with both technology and the internet.

_YouTube in 2012_

Using the Wayback Machine, I was able to go through some of my favorite websites from when I was a kid. Some of those websites were CoolMathGames, Instagram, Netflix, YouTube, and many others. Back in the day, with these types of websites, there was a distinct pattern in which they all had harsh colors, sharp image cropping, and overall had a lifeless distinction to them. Nowadays, when you visit these same websites, they all have this modern touch to it such as having a better color gradients and similar placements with buttons and text boxes.

_CoolMathGames in 2014_

After going through all of these different websites, it’s clear on what has become the standard norm for current day websites. Colorful graphics, gifs, animations, and overall a modern "touch" is what makes our favorite websites so popular. It’s not entirely jarring to see that these set standards have taken place because of how it represents on how far digital media has come. Going through these websites as their older versions was very refreshing as it reminded me of how simple things used to be.

# Reflective Blog 3

**Prompt C:** Ask a generative AI tool (maybe one in Boodlebox or Copilot) to generate something you might have to write in your future career. Assess the result, and then revise your prompt or "stack" an additional prompt onto it (e.g., "remove the passive voice and add headings"). Congratulations, you're a prompt engineer now. Add this skill to your resume. On your website, post: 1) your original and revised prompts 2) your assessment of what it generated 3) (optional) what it generated.

**Original Prompt:** "Generate something for me where I might have to write in my future career as an Associate QA Analyst for a Sample Web Application."

**Revised Prompt:** "Create a section to the document that is dedicated for a cybersecurity analyst."

I chose this prompt because it allows me to continue my practices in working with generative AI tools, specifically within the role of my upcoming career since it is highly encouraged to use. I asked ChatGPT (version 4o) to generate for me a **sample Test Case document** to help me write as an Associate QA Analyst for a Sample Web Application. The AI tool laid out a perfect document with the expected results, similar to that of the testing tools I have personally used in the past. It is the perfect document in the case that any testing tools used by any company is down for maintenance or experiencing technical difficulties during normal work hours. Since it was a simple document, I asked ChatGPT to also **add a Cybersecurity Section** to amplify the document in the event that any security testing needed to be done and written. It laid out a simple and yet perfect sample format to which it needed little to no editing. The only issue I encountered with this was when I had asked the AI tool to allow me to download, it kept crashing out. So eventually, once it allowed me to download it, I had to make certain edits to the documents to make them readable. I’ve provided the following documents as PDF files, each corresponding to their respective prompts.

# Reflective Blog 4

**Prompt Q:** Upload your resume (without your address, phone number, and email) to a generative AI tool of your choice (I suggest trying one in Boodlebox). Ask it what position you are best suited for, then ask it to revise your resume to make it more appealing to a future employer in your ideal field. Post: A summary of the suggested changes and a reflection. What did it do? What did you learn? 

I ended up using ChatGPT (version 4o) as the generative AI tool for this assignment. After uploading my resume and asking what the positions I was best suited for, it listed off the following: Quality Assurance Analyst/Software Tester, Software/Front-end developer, Web developer, IT Support/Technical Analyst, and Business Analyst (Tech Focused). This was actually quite interesting because these are all positions that I was already previously interested in for future full-time employment. However upon asking the AI tool to revise my resume to make it more appealing to a future employer in my ideal field as an Associate QA Analyst, it didn’t change much of it other than rewriting my technical skills with bullets to indicate their respective fields. It also enhanced the work experience section by rewriting my previous internship experience with a much better tone and getting rid of certain bullets from past employment. To finish it off, it included an additional project to add upon and added a new section for only certifications and additional qualifications.  What I learned from this is that my resume could use a little bit of polishing to make it look nicer for future employers, but overall, it’s still very strong resume that can be guaranteed to help me land an entry-level job post-graduation.

_Note: ChatGPT version 4o was used for this assignment. For this assignment prompt, I decided to change my name on my resume as well as deleting all of my personal and contact information so that the generative AI tool doesn’t have any of my personal information. However in the document provided, you'll see that it is still my name since I reverted it to it's original state for this assignment._

# Reflective Blog 5

**Prompt R:** After you have completed the Chatbot assignment or any assignment using AI for most of the work, reflect on your interaction with this emerging technology: What does AI do well? What does it not do well? What did you have to correct or re-prompt it to modify? What can you know about its training data? What kinds of data was included? What kinds of data was excluded? What do you think the future holds as this technology is used and further advanced?

What the AI does well is immediately utilize what it was given and work effectively for a passive user looking to use the chatbot. What it doesn’t do very well is go above and beyond specific requests since it is a very basic and comprehensive guide dedicated to only provide for a general user and not any specific demographic. The only thing I had to correct to modify it to make it work better was to add more detailed steps on what to provide for the user. Its training data is very simple, as there are no outside sources being given to the chatbot model other than its very basic instructions to deliver exceptional results. No additional data was included or excluded. I believe that the future of this technology will continue to get better and allow for an everyday average user to be able to create their own chatbot, should they choose to create their own website/software based on their needs.

_AI Statement: No AI was used for this assignment specifically, however it is dedicated to the chatbot assignment, which utilizes ChatGPT 4o-mini through BoodleBox._
