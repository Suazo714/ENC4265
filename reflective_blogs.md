# Wayback Analysis

I believe that there’s a set standard when it comes to visiting almost any sort of website these days. Over the last few years, there has been a push for a more “modern” appeal to just about everything that we come into contact within our daily lives. From homes to public transportation, classroom technology, entertainment, the internet, etc. Because of this, I think it's quite interesting on how far we have come with both technology and the internet.

_YouTube in 2012_

Using the Wayback Machine, I was able to go through some of my favorite websites from when I was a kid. Some of those websites were CoolMathGames, Instagram, Netflix, YouTube, and many others. Back in the day, with these types of websites, there was a distinct pattern in which they all had harsh colors, sharp image cropping, and overall had a lifeless distinction to them. Nowadays, when you visit these same websites, they all have this modern touch to it such as having a better color gradients and similar placements with buttons and text boxes.

_CoolMathGames in 2014_

After going through all of these different websites, it’s clear on what has become the standard norm for current day websites. Colorful graphics, gifs, animations, and overall a modern "touch" is what makes our favorite websites so popular. It’s not entirely jarring to see that these set standards have taken place because of how it represents on how far digital media has come. Going through these websites as their older versions was very refreshing as it reminded me of how simple things used to be.

# Quick Start Guide

## Assignment Rationale 
This assignment will let you experiment with a generative AI tool of your choice, and you will strengthen your critical thinking skills as you evaluate its strengths and weaknesses.

## Where to Start
Think of a product that you already know how to use. It can be a bluetooth headset, an app, a video game, a sewing machine, or anything that requires a little bit of setup to use.

## Assignment Steps
This assignment is a little more structured than others in our course, so please follow these steps:
1. Open Copilot or any other text-based generative AI tool you prefer (don't pay for it unless you happen to already have a subscription)
2. Write a prompt that asks it to generate a quick-start guide for your product of choice. (copy and paste this somewhere - it is part of what you need to turn in)
3. Evaluate the output. Try to follow the steps yourself, or at least imagine following them.
4. Prompt it again (and again) if needed (again saving your prompts somewhere).
5. Reflect on the process and write a short (200 words) reflection on the tool's strengths, weaknesses, and anything that you learned (or anything that surprised you).

## What is Due
On your portfolio, post the following:
-The name of the tool (with the link if you have it)
-Your prompts
-The best output 
-Your reflection
