## A Bit About Me 
Hello, I'm Joan! Iâ€™m currently an IT major at the University of Central Florida and a Software and Web Developer and QA Analyst with a passion for creating user-friendly experiences. I create and test websites and software that help organizations address business challenges and meet their needs as well as manage everything from site navigation and layout to web hosting, data implementation, and using high quality testing tools with project management software to help keep track of all ongoing challenges.
