## A Bit About Me 
Hello, I'm Joan! I’m currently an IT major at the University of Central Florida and Software and Web Developer and QA Analyst with a passion for creating user-friendly experiences. I create and test websites that help organizations address business challenges and meet their needs as well as manage everything from website navigation and layout to web hosting and data implementation.
